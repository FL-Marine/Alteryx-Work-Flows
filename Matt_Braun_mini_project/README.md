For example:  Mini-Project for you....
Pretend your boss gave this dataset. 
If you open the file called Question 72. There are 5 columns of data:

Number of People

And asked you for the following:
1. What is the total number of people from each port?
2. What vehicle type had the most passengers?

4. Create a "pivot table" like structure with:
Port Name on Rows
Vehicle Type on Columns
